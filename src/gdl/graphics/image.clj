; TODO
; lots of simplification potential -> constructor take texture-region directly?, no need so many
; complicated constructors
; sprite-batch or scaling factor can set unit-scale ? independent ?
; pass dimensions @ image component (body dimensions?)
; => maybe store on rendering the dimensions per unit-scale as a side effect (cache)
; inside the 'image'
; maybe use only texture-region itself (for example in game.properties,
; need in ui only texture-region also and no image ....) only required @ game., not property-editor.

; Explanation why not using libgdx Sprite class:
; * mutable fields
; * render in certain position/scale -> the sprite is modified somewhere else !
; * would have to reset it after every render ... or copy ?...
; * -> I cache only dimensions & scale for my texture-regions
; * color & rotation applied on rendering
