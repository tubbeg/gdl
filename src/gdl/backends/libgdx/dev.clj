(ns gdl.backends.libgdx.dev
  "Starts a dev loop using clojure.tools.namespace.repl/refresh in order to restart the app without
  restarting the JVM.
  Also starts an nrepl server which will keep up even between app crashes and restarts.

  How to use:
  lein run -m gdl.backends.libgdx.dev ~app-namespace~ ~app-fn-with-no-args~

  Example:
  lein run -m gdl.backends.libgdx.dev gdl.simple-test app

  See also project.clj for the `lein dev` shortcut.

  In case of an error, the console prints `WAITING FOR RESTART` and
  the `/restart!` function will restart the app and call `refresh`.

  You can bind this on a key for smooth dev experience, here in VIM:
  ``` vimscript
  nmap <F5> :Eval (do (in-ns 'gdl.backends.libgdx.dev)(restart!))
  ```"
